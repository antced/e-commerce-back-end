This is a back end for an e-commerce website. It uses Express.js for the API and Sequelize to connect to a MySQL database.

## Installation

First, log in to MySQL and use 'SOURCE db/schema.sql;' to create the database.
Then quit and run 'node seeds'.
Then run 'node server.js' and use Insomnia to test.

## Usage

Run Insomnia GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests at each API route.

## Credits

Worked on as a project for UPENN's coding bootcamp under the instruction of Leif Hetland, with help from Eric, Justin, Leon, and Layne.
